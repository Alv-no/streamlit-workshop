def display_images_widget(file_paths: list[str]) -> None:
    """
    Displays a series of images in a Streamlit app from the specified file paths.

    This function takes a list of file paths to images stored locally and displays them sequentially
    in a Streamlit app. It's designed to be used within a Streamlit page to showcase images, such as
    screenshots, diagrams, or photos relevant to the app's content.

    Args:
        image_paths (list[str]): A list of strings, where each string is a file path to an image.

    Returns:
        None. This function directly renders images to the Streamlit app interface.

    Example:
        To use this function in a Streamlit app, first import the function and then call it with a list of image file paths:

        ```python
        import streamlit as st
        from frontend_widgets.display_image_widget import display_images_widget

        # Page Configuration
        st.set_page_config(page_title="Workshop #4", layout="wide")

        # List of image file paths
        FILE_PATHS: list[str] = ["data/fullstack_app.png", "data/streamlit.png"]

        # Display the title and a divider
        st.title("ðŸŒŸ Del 1: Intro")
        st.divider()

        # Introductory text
        st.write("### Hva er egentlig Streamlit?")

        # Display the images
        display_images_widget(FILE_PATHS)
        ```
